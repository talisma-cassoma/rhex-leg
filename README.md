The most important mechanical part of the robot is the legs. They are manufactured from fiberglass with a special manufacturing process. The fiberglass is chosen to be with a %50-%50 distribution of fibers in the 0-90 degrees orientation. The matrix which is made from multi layer fiberglass with different orientations is then pre-impregnated in epoxy resin.
